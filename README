Resident Evil, PS1, Game, PAL
Resident Evil, PC, Game
Resident Evil 2, PS1, Demo
Resident Evil 2, PC, Demo
Resident Evil 3, PS1, Game, PAL

Note:

All PS1 demos and games use same image format, so it should be easy to add
support for them. I just need a list of all files on each CD (recursive directory
tree).

Resident Evil 3 PC (demo and maybe game) use a specific archive file format to
store files datas, and will be supported soon.
