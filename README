			Resident Evil games



0 Disclaimer

This software is just a background image viewer for some versions of the games.
Use at your own risks.


1 Libraries dependencies

- SDL_image with libjpeg support.
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

- PhysicsFS for all filesystem access.

  Note: You need to apply the patch in the diff directory to the stable 1.0
  release of PhysicsFS to have support for Resident Evil 3 PC archive files.

  Default is current directory.
  Example: -basedir /demos/re2demo

"-gamma <value>" to change the gamma correction of the lightmaps.
  Default is 1.0 .

Resident Evil 2, PS1, Demo

Resident Evil 3, PS1, Game, PAL

All PS1 demos and games use same image format, so it should be easy to add
support for them. I just need a list of all files on each CD (recursive directory
tree).
