5 Notes/bugs
------------

All PS1 demos and games use same image format, so it should be easy to add
support for them. I just need a list of all files on each CD (recursive directory
tree).

Missing stuff, because I don't know where the needed data is stored:
  RE2 PC full game, RE2 PS1, RE3 PS1: No masks for background image
  RE3 PS1: No model rendering
